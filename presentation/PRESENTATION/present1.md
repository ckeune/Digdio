Crunching big data - MapReduce
===

You and your 9 best friends are at National library. You are given 1 million of books and you need to find how many books have a title longer than 255 symbols?

* Divide randomly the books
* Separately, find all books matching the criteria and count them
* Get total answer

Why do you need 9 friends?
